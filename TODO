Put a TODO list of "features coming soon" on the Web site
(request by Yang Liu)

Document, document, document!
Write package documentation.
Write more examples.

Think about interfaces that pass training, validation, and testing lists, and consider alternative.

Remove all System.out.println statements, and replace with java.util.logging.
Make the loggers not print the times and locations

Remove the ability to make a Alphabet stop growing?

Create a MultiplexingPipe that will route an input depending on class.

Figure out a plan for Transducer's inputPipe and outputPipe.

Make it easier to create a pipeline, extract some training data,
freeze the vocabularies and train a classifier or extractor, and then
run the pipeline again to get some testing data.  The current use of
Instance.List.split() leaks feature information about the test set
into the trainer via the Alphabet, (although this doesn't effect most
current algorithm implementations.).

Clean up naming inconsistencies between RankedFeatureVector and Labeling.
Already taken care of?

Sometimes method names use "get..." others don't.  Understand Java
convention.  Is there a Java convention?

Change interface for setFeatureSelection and
setPerClassFeatureSelection to enforce exclusivity?

Add an interface for all objects that carry a Vocabulary, and have InstanceList check
this at appropriate times.

Collapse CRF and CRF2 into CRF3.

Consider adding Signature object to hold the inputAlphabet and
outputAlphabet of a Pipe, Classifier, Extractor, etc.

Add more documentation, especially in package.html files.

Later replace minimize package with maximize package.

Replace the ClassifierEvaluating and TransducerEvaluating interfaces
with a more sensible and extensible alternative.



DONE

Collapse PipedInstance and RawInstance into Instance
Add setTarget(), etc methods to Instance.
Add lock() method to Instance.
Change Instance.List to InstanceList.
Collapse Pipe.Carrier into Instance.
Collapse DictionariedPipe into Pipe.
Change Label.Alphabet to LabelAlphabet, and remove all such inner classes.
Change Vocabulary to Alphabet
Use RankedFeatureVector.Factory class.

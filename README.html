<p>
MALLET is an integrated collection of Java code useful for statistical
natural language processing, document classification, clustering,
information extraction, and other machine learning applications to
text.

<p> 
Documentation for MALLET is available at the 
<a href=http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Main_Page>MALLET web page</a>.  
In particular there are 
<a href=http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Tutorials>tutorials</a>
on using MALLET as well as on using the <a href=http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Jython:Main>Jython language to write scripts for Mallet</a>. 


<p>
Mallet was written by <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum">Andrew
McCallum</a>, with contributions from several graduate students
and staff, including Aron Culotta, Al Hough, Wei Li, David Pinto,
 Charles Sutton, and Jerod Wienman, at University of Massachusetts Amherst, as well as contributions from Fernando Pereira, Ryan McDonald, and others at University of Pennsylvania.

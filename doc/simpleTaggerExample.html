<h1>SimpleTagger Example</h1>

SimpleTagger is a command line interface to the MALLET Conditional
Random Field(CRF) class. Here we present an
 extremely simple example showing the use of SimpleTagger to label
a sequence of text.

<p>
Given an input file "sample" as follows:

<pre>
CAPITAL Bill  noun
        slept non-noun
        here non-noun
</pre>

where all but the last token on each line is a binary feature,
and the last token on the line is the label name, a CRF
can be created with SimpleTagger as follows (on one line):

<pre>
hough@gobur:~/tagger-test$ java -cp 
 "/home/hough/mallet/class:/home/hough/mallet/lib/mallet-deps.jar"
 edu.umass.cs.mallet.base.fst.SimpleTagger
  --train true --model-file nouncrf  sample
</pre>
This assumes that mallet has been installed and built in /home/hough/mallet. Note that we specify the MALLET
build directory (/home/hough/mallet/class) and the necessary MALLET jar files
(/home/hough/mallet/mallet-deps.jar) in the classpath.
The <tt>--train true</tt> option specifies that we are training, and 
<tt>--model-file nouncrf</tt> specifies where we would like the CRF written to.

<p>
This produces a trained CRF in the file "nouncrf".

<p>
If we have a file "stest" we would like labelled:
<pre>
CAPITAL Al
        slept
        here
</pre>

we can do this with the CRF in file <tt>nouncrf</tt> by typing:
<pre>
hough@gobur:~/tagger-test$ java -cp
"/home/hough/mallet/class:/home/hough/mallet/lib/mallet-deps.jar"
 edu.umass.cs.mallet.base.fst.SimpleTagger
--model-file nouncrf  stest
</pre>

which produces the following output:

<pre>
Number of predicates: 5
noun CAPITAL Al
non-noun  slept
non-noun  here
</pre>

<p>
A list of all the options available with SimpleTagger can be obtained
by specifying the <tt>--help</tt> option:
<pre>
hough@gobur:~/tagger-test$ java -cp
"/home/hough/mallet/class:/home/hough/mallet/lib/mallet-deps.jar"
 edu.umass.cs.mallet.base.fst.SimpleTagger
--help
</pre>

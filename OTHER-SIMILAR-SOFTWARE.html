<h2>Software Similar to MALLET</h2>

<p>There are numerous other software packages relevant to machine learning
and text that in various ways are related to MALLET:

<ul>
<li> NLTK
  (<a href="http://nltk.sourceforge.net/">http://nltk.sourceforge.net</a>)
  also has "Classifier" and "ClassifierTrainer" classes for plug-and-play
  classifiers, as well as implementations of Naive Bayes, MaxEnt,
  feature selection, a "Token" class, finite state transducers
  with iterators over transitions.  In addition it has 
  facilities for tagging, parsing and information extraction.

<li> OpenNLP
  (<a href="http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/">http://opennlp.sourceforge.net</a>)
  is also a Java package intended for text processing.
  It also has rich Pipelines consisting of chains of individual pipe 
  Foo2Bar component steps that can be arbitrarily configured and
  plugged together.

<li> <a href="http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/javanlp/">JavaNLP</a> (from
	Chris Manning's group at Stanford.)  

<li> <a href="http://www.biojava.org/">BioJava</a>.  The BioJava
Project is an open-source project dedicated to providing Java tools
for processing biological data. This will include objects for
manipulating sequences, file parsers, CORBA interoperability, DAS,
access to ACeDB, dynamic programming, and simple statistical routines
to name just a few things.

<li> There is information about various Finite State Machine software at
  <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/405/software.html">http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/405/software.html</a>,
  including pointers to AT&T Finite State package, which also has
  very general finite state transducers with iterators over
  transitions, arbitrary transition costs, generalized implementations
  of Viterbi and Forward Backward.  In
  addition it has epsilon transitions, composition, and much more.

<li> Weka: Plug-and-play machine learning components in Java
  <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka">http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka</a>,
  including classes for "Classifier", "NaiveBayes", "DecisionStump",
  "LogisticRegression", etc.  It also has methods for splitting
  training sets, and nice evaluation tools, and GUI components to boot.

<li> Orange, component-based data mining software in C++ includes SVM, 
  logistic regression, clustering, and lots more.
  <a href="http://magix.fri.uni-lj.si/orange/">http://magix.fri.uni-lj.si/orange/</a>.

<li> Libbow
  <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mccallum/bow">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mccallum/bow</a>
  also has mechanisms for feature extraction pipelines, plug-and-play classifiers,
  feature selection, clustering.  It is written in C.

<li> COLT: High Performance Scientific Computing in Java:
  <a href="http://tilde-hoschek.home.cern.ch/~hoschek/colt/">http://tilde-hoschek.home.cern.ch/~hoschek/colt</a>.

<li> There are Java applets for various machine learning algorithms at
  <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417">http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417</a>.

<li> Bayesian Networks in Java: 
     <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~javabayes">http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~javabayes</a>.

<li> Fe Sha and Fernando Pereira have written a CRF implementation
  in Java.

<li> <a href="http://www.panscient.com">Jonathan Baxter</a> wrote much
  machine learning code in the late 1990's, including a rich "optimization" package.

<li> <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mooney">Ray Mooney</a> has 
    also been writing machine learning code in Java lately.
